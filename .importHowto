#If you want to commit all of these changes, run: 
    git commit -a

 #and enter your commit message. This creates a local commit only. It hasn't been pushed to the SVN server yet. If you only want to add changes from some files but not others, run: 
    git add file1 file2 file3 ...
    git add -i file4 # if you only want to add some diff hunks and not others
    git commit

 #and enter your commit message. After this, 'git diff' will still show the uncommitted changes. While you're adding changes to be committed, you can run 'git diff --cached' to see what's going to go in the next commit. 

# After you've made however many commits, you can push up to the svn server with: 
    git svn dcommit

# That will also bring your local tree up to date. To bring your tree up to date in general, run: 
    git svn rebase

# This will update your local checkout and then re-apply your local un-submitted commits on top of the new trunk. 

# If you want to get the commits for all branches that exist in your clone: 
    git svn fetch
